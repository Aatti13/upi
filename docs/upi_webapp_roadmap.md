## Key Technical Considerations

### Database Schema Design
- **Users**: id, phone, email, name, pin_hash, kyc_status, created_at
- **Wallets**: id, user_id, balance, currency, status, updated_at
- **Transactions**: id, sender_id, receiver_id, amount, type, status, reference_id, created_at
- **Merchants**: id, business_name, upi_id, settlement_account, commission_rate
- **Audit_Logs**: id, user_id, action, details, ip_address, timestamp

### Security Requirements
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Multi-factor authentication for high-value transactions
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
- Compliance with PCI DSS standards
- Real-time fraud detection and prevention

### Performance Targets
- API response time < 200ms for 95% of requests
- Support 1000+ concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime availability
- Database query optimization for transaction history
- Efficient caching for frequently accessed data

### Deployment Architecture
- Microservices architecture with containerization
- Load balancer with auto-scaling capabilities
- Database replication and backup strategies
- CDN for frontend assets and static content
- Monitoring and alerting for all critical components
