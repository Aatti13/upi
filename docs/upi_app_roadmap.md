## Daily Development Best Practices

### Code Quality Standards
- **Code Reviews**: All code must pass peer review
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 80%+ unit test coverage
- **Documentation**: Update API docs with every endpoint change
- **Security**: Run security scans on every commit
- **Performance**: Monitor API response times < 200ms

### PostgreSQL Optimization Tasks
- **Connection Pooling**: Configure PgBouncer for connection management
- **Indexing Strategy**: Create indexes for frequently queried columns
- **Partitioning**: Implement table partitioning for large transaction tables
- **Read Replicas**: Set up read replicas for query load distribution
- **Backup Strategy**: Configure automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery

### Redis Configuration Tasks
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement cache-aside pattern for user sessions
- **Session Management**: Store JWT tokens and user sessions
- **Rate Limiting**: Use Redis for API rate limiting counters
- **Pub/Sub**: Implement real-time notifications using Redis Pub/Sub
- **Persistence**: Configure RDB and AOF for data durability

### Security Checkpoints
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **API Security**: Implement OAuth 2.0, rate limiting, and input validation
- **PCI Compliance**: Ensure payment data handling meets PCI DSS standards
- **Audit Logging**: Log all financial transactions and user actions
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct security testing before production

### Production Environment
```
┌─── Load Balancer (HAProxy/NGINX)
├─── API Gateway (Kong)
├─── Kubernetes Cluster
│    ├── User Service (3 replicas)
│    ├── Payment Service (5 replicas)  
│    ├── Account Service (3 replicas)
│    ├── Auth Service (2 replicas)
│    ├── Notification Service (2 replicas)
│    └── Audit Service (2 replicas)
├─── PostgreSQL Cluster (Primary + 2 Replicas)
├─── Redis Cluster (3 nodes)
└─── Monitoring Stack (Prometheus + Grafana)
```

### Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Services can scale independently based on load
- **Database Sharding**: Partition transaction data by user ID or time
- **CDN Integration**: Serve static assets through CloudFront/CloudFlare
- **Async Processing**: Use message queues for non-critical operations
- **Caching Layers**: Multi-level caching (Redis, CDN, Application)
